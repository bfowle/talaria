## Edge Case Analysis

### Problematic Sequence Categories

Some sequence types present challenges for reduction algorithms:

| Category | Description | Count | Retention Rate | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Short sequences (< 50 aa) | Very short proteins | 23,456 | 96.8% | Length bias |
| Highly repetitive | Tandem repeats, low complexity | 12,345 | 94.2% | Clustering challenges |
| Hypothetical proteins | Unknown function | 45,678 | 97.8% | Limited homology |
| Single-copy orthologs | Essential genes | 8,901 | 99.9% | High priority retention |
| Rapidly evolving | High mutation rate | 15,234 | 95.4% | Sequence divergence |

### Quality Recovery Strategies

For sequences with lower retention rates:

1. **Manual Curation**: Review critical sequences for forced inclusion
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple clustering methods
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-pass reduction with quality checkpoints
4. **Domain-aware Clustering**: Preserve essential functional domains
