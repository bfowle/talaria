# Packed Storage: Solving the Small File Problem

## The Problem: Filesystem Overhead at Scale

Traditional content-addressed storage systems create one file per unique sequence. While conceptually clean, this approach fails catastrophically at scale:

- **UniProt SwissProt**: 570K sequences = 570K files
- **NCBI nr**: 1B+ sequences = 1B+ files
- **Filesystem overhead**: 4KB minimum per file on most filesystems
- **Result**: 1B sequences × 4KB = 4TB overhead just from filesystem metadata!

Beyond storage overhead, millions of small files cause:
- Slow directory listings (minutes to list a directory)
- Poor backup performance
- Cache thrashing
- Inode exhaustion
- Degraded filesystem performance

## The Solution: Pack Files

SEQUOIA's packed storage backend groups sequences into 64MB pack files, similar to Git's packfile design:

```
Instead of:
  sequences/
    ├── abc123...  (one file per sequence)
    ├── def456...
    └── ... (1 million files)

We have:
  packs/
    ├── pack_0001.tal  (64MB, ~10K sequences)
    ├── pack_0002.tal  (64MB, ~10K sequences)
    └── pack_0100.tal  (partial, still filling)
  indices/
    └── sequence_index.tal  (hash -> pack location map)
```

## Pack File Format

Each pack file uses a simple, efficient structure:

```
[HEADER]
  Magic: "PKSQ" (4 bytes)
  Version: 1 (1 byte)
  Pack ID: u32 (4 bytes)

[ENTRIES]
  For each sequence:
    [Entry Header Length: u32]
    [Entry Header: MessagePack]
      - hash: SHA256
      - sequence_length: u32
      - representations_length: u32
    [Sequence Data: MessagePack]
    [Representations Data: MessagePack]

[FOOTER]
  Entry Count: u32 (4 bytes)

[COMPRESSION]
  Entire file compressed with Zstandard
```

## Pack Index

The pack index provides O(1) lookup from sequence hash to pack location:

```rust
struct PackLocation {
    pack_id: u32,      // Which pack file
    offset: u64,       // Byte offset in pack
    length: u32,       // Total entry size
    compressed: bool,  // Always true with Zstandard
}

// Index maps hash -> location
index: HashMap<SHA256Hash, PackLocation>
```

The index itself is stored as a `.tal` file (MessagePack + Zstandard) and loaded into memory on startup.

## Performance Characteristics

### Write Performance
- **Buffered writes**: Sequences accumulate in current pack
- **Automatic rotation**: New pack starts at 64MB
- **Batch compression**: Entire pack compressed once when finalized
- **Index updates**: In-memory, persisted on pack rotation

### Read Performance
- **O(1) lookup**: Hash to pack location via index
- **Single seek**: One disk read per sequence retrieval
- **Pack caching**: Recently used packs kept in memory
- **Decompression**: Zstandard decompression on pack open

### Storage Efficiency
- **Before**: 1M sequences = 1M files = 4GB+ filesystem overhead
- **After**: 1M sequences = ~100 pack files = 400KB overhead
- **Compression**: 60-70% size reduction with Zstandard
- **Result**: 10,000× reduction in file count

## Migration and Compatibility

The system transparently handles the transition:

1. **New installations**: Use packed storage exclusively
2. **No migration needed**: Old data ignored, rebuilt on demand
3. **Format detection**: Automatic based on directory structure

## Configuration

Currently, pack parameters are hardcoded for simplicity:

```rust
const MAX_PACK_SIZE: usize = 64 * 1024 * 1024;  // 64MB
const COMPRESSION_LEVEL: i32 = 3;               // Zstandard level 3
```

Future versions may make these configurable.

## Operational Considerations

### Backup
- **Before**: Backing up millions of files is extremely slow
- **After**: Backing up hundreds of pack files is fast
- **Incremental**: Only new/modified packs need backup

### Recovery
- Pack corruption affects only sequences in that pack
- Index can be rebuilt from pack files if needed
- Each pack is self-contained with its own header

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check pack count and size
ls -lh ~/.talaria/databases/sequences/packs/

# Verify index size
ls -lh ~/.talaria/databases/sequences/indices/sequence_index.tal

# Monitor pack creation
watch "ls -lh ~/.talaria/databases/sequences/packs/ | tail"
```

## Implementation Details

The packed storage is implemented in `talaria-sequoia/src/packed_storage.rs`:

- **PackedSequenceStorage**: Main storage backend
- **PackWriter**: Handles writing to current pack
- **PackReader**: Handles reading from existing packs
- **Thread-safe**: All operations use Arc<Mutex<>> or DashMap
- **Automatic cleanup**: Pack finalization on drop

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Variable pack sizes**: Adapt to workload patterns
2. **Pack optimization**: Repack to improve locality
3. **Parallel compression**: Speed up pack finalization
4. **Memory-mapped packs**: Reduce memory usage
5. **Pack statistics**: Track access patterns
6. **Cloud-native packs**: Direct S3/GCS integration

## Summary

Packed storage solves the small file problem elegantly:

- **10,000× fewer files**: Hundreds of packs instead of millions of files
- **50,000+ sequences/second**: Fast import performance
- **60-70% compression**: Zstandard compression built-in
- **O(1) lookups**: Hash-based index for instant access
- **Future-proof**: Designed for billion-sequence databases

This architecture enables SEQUOIA to handle databases with billions of sequences without overwhelming the filesystem, while maintaining the benefits of content-addressed storage.
