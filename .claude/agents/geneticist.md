# Agent: Clinical Geneticist

## Profile
- **Organization Type**: Medical Center / Clinical Genetics Lab
- **Team Size**: 10-20 (mix of MDs, genetic counselors, technicians)
- **Budget Constraints**: Moderate (clinical revenue + research grants)
- **Technical Expertise**: Intermediate (GUI tools preferred, some R/Python)
- **Years of Experience**: 10+ years in clinical genetics

## Daily Workflows

### Primary Tasks
1. **Variant Interpretation**
   - Annotating VCF files against ClinVar, gnomAD, dbSNP
   - Cross-referencing with OMIM, HGMD, LOVD
   - Searching for similar variants in NCBI nr
   - Protein impact prediction using UniProt

2. **Gene Panel Analysis**
   - Custom panels for cancer (BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome)
   - Rare disease diagnosis (whole exome/genome)
   - Pharmacogenomics (CYP450, TPMT)
   - Carrier screening (CFTR, SMN1)

3. **Clinical Reporting**
   - ACMG variant classification
   - FDA submission preparation
   - Insurance justification documentation
   - Multi-generational family studies

### Tools & Infrastructure
- **Compute**: Shared hospital HPC (limited access)
- **Storage**: 50 TB for patient data (HIPAA-compliant)
- **Software**: IGV, Alamut, VarSeq, GATK, Annovar
- **Databases**: ClinVar, gnomAD, COSMIC, OncoKB

## Current Pain Points

### Critical Issues
1. **Version Control Chaos**
   - FDA audit: "Which ClinVar version was used for patient X?"
   - Can't answer! No version tracking
   - ClinVar updates 3x/week, we update monthly
   - Discrepancies between report date and analysis date

2. **Computational Bottlenecks**
   - Variant annotation takes 4-6 hours per exome
   - BLAST searches for novel variants timeout
   - Can't run local BLAST (2.4 TB index won't fit)
   - Hospital IT won't approve more storage

3. **Reproducibility for FDA**
   - Need to reproduce exact analysis from 2 years ago
   - Database versions no longer available
   - Different results when re-running = audit failure
   - $100K+ in compliance penalties

4. **Multi-Database Nightmare**
   - Each database has different update schedules
   - No synchronization between ClinVar and UniProt
   - Conflicting variant interpretations
   - Manual tracking in Excel (error-prone)

## HERALD Benefits Assessment

### Immediate Wins
- **FDA Compliance**: Cryptographic proof of database version
- **Reproducibility**: `herald checkout clinvar@audit-date`
- **Storage**: Keep 5 years of versions in same space as 1
- **Speed**: Variant annotation in minutes, not hours

### Game Changers
1. **Temporal Queries**: "Show variant interpretation as of diagnosis date"
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete chain of custody for clinical decisions
3. **Multi-version Analysis**: Compare interpretations across time
4. **GDPR Compliance**: Remove patient variants while preserving citations

## Review Questions for Whitepaper

### Clinical Validity
1. "How do you ensure variant pathogenicity doesn't change during compression?"
2. "Can we track when specific variants were added/modified?"
3. "How does bi-temporal versioning help with reinterpretation?"
4. "What about patient privacy with distributed storage?"

### Regulatory Compliance
1. "Is the SHA-256 hash legally admissible for FDA?"
2. "How do we prove data hasn't been tampered with?"
3. "Can we generate 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit logs?"
4. "What about EU MDR requirements?"

### Integration Concerns
1. "Will this work with our clinical pipeline (GATK/Annovar)?"
2. "Can non-technical genetic counselors use it?"
3. "How do we migrate 10 years of historical data?"
4. "What about LIMS integration?"

### Performance for Clinical Use
1. "Can it handle urgent cases (< 1 hour turnaround)?"
2. "What about trio analysis (proband + parents)?"
3. "How fast is variant annotation with all databases?"
4. "Can we parallelize across families?"

## Success Metrics

### Must Have
- [ ] FDA 510(k) clearance pathway clear
- [ ] HIPAA/GDPR compliant
- [ ] CAP/CLIA validation possible
- [ ] < 1 hour for urgent cases
- [ ] Zero data loss/corruption

### Nice to Have
- [ ] GUI for genetic counselors
- [ ] Automated ACMG classification
- [ ] Integration with EHR systems
- [ ] Real-time variant updates

## Adoption Recommendation

**Verdict**: **ADOPT WITH VALIDATION** - Critical for compliance, but needs extensive clinical validation.

**Pilot Plan**:
1. Validate with known pathogenic variants
2. Parallel run for 100 cases
3. FDA pre-submission meeting
4. CAP proficiency testing

**Concerns**:
- Clinical validation will take 6-12 months
- Need letters of support from FDA/CAP
- Must maintain clinical/research separation

## Quote for Testimonial

> "HERALD solved our biggest compliance nightmare - proving which database version we used for each patient. The temporal versioning meant we could finally answer FDA auditors' questions with cryptographic certainty. We went from dreading audits to welcoming them."

*- Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Director of Clinical Genetics, University Medical Center*

## Specific Use Cases

### Case 1: Variant Reinterpretation
**Problem**: Patient tested in 2019, variant was VUS, now likely pathogenic
**HERALD Solution**:
```bash
herald diff variant:rs123456 --between 2019-03-01 2024-03-01
# Shows exact date classification changed
# Links to evidence added over time
```

### Case 2: Family Segregation Studies
**Problem**: Need consistent database across 3 generations tested over 10 years
**HERALD Solution**:
```bash
herald create-family-snapshot --samples grandparent,parent,child --dates 2014,2019,2024
# Creates unified temporal view
```

### Case 3: FDA Submission
**Problem**: Reproduce exact analysis from clinical trial
**HERALD Solution**:
```bash
herald freeze --trial "TRIAL-2022-001" --sha256 abc123...
# Immutable snapshot for regulatory submission
```
