abstract: >-
  Talaria is a high-performance bioinformatics tool that intelligently reduces
  biological sequence databases (FASTA files) to optimize them for indexing with
  various aligners. By leveraging content-addressed storage, Merkle DAGs, and
  bi-temporal versioning through the HERALD architecture, Talaria achieves
  60-70% size reduction while maintaining biological coverage. It provides
  optimized output for LAMBDA, BLAST, DIAMOND, MMseqs2, Kraken, and other
  popular alignment tools.
