// This module previously contained storage traits that have been moved to talaria-sequoia
// to avoid circular dependencies. talaria-storage now focuses on providing low-level
// storage backends and utilities, while business logic traits live in talaria-sequoia.

// The following traits have been moved to talaria-sequoia/src/storage/traits.rs:
// - ChunkStorage
// - DeltaStorage
// - ReductionStorage
// - TaxonomyStorage
// - RemoteStorage
// - StatefulStorage

// This file is kept empty to maintain module structure but may be removed in future.
